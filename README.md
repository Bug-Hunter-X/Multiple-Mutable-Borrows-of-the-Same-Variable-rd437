# Multiple Mutable Borrows in Rust

This repository demonstrates a common error in Rust: attempting to create multiple mutable borrows of the same variable.  Rust's borrow checker prevents this to ensure data safety and avoid race conditions.  The `bug.rs` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.rs` provides a corrected version.

## How to reproduce the bug

1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the directory.
3. Run `rustc bug.rs` and then `./bug`.

You will observe a compiler error indicating that multiple mutable borrows are not allowed.

## Understanding the solution

The solution involves restructuring the code to avoid multiple mutable borrows. This often involves using techniques like cloning, borrowing immutably where possible, or using interior mutability (e.g., `RefCell` or `Mutex`). The example shows one approach to solve this problem.
